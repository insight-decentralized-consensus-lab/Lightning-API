# Pay-per-call API access 

## Abstract: 
State channels such as the Lightning Network permit rapid micropayments with low fees (since settlement on the main chain only occurs when the channel is closed). Replace the current API subscription model (e.g. $$/month) with pay-per-call API access (e.g. BTC/call) over efficient channels.

## Project Motivation: 
Pay-per-call API access could significantly displace subscription models, especially for non-institutional parties that would like to ping some data source a few times for O($) but cannot afford the O($$$$) subscription fee. May have huge implications for Smart Contract <> Oracle.

## Fellow Motivation: 
Many projects are counting on state channel technology for scaling, so demonstrating mastery of lightning network implementation should create a strong positive impression. This would showcase a little bit of savvy on the blockchain side and the data infrastructure end.
